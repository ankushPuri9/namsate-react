# What is NPM
    . NPM is just a package manager it's not node package manager .
    . Npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js so we call it node package manager
# What is package.json
    . Package.json is configration of NPM

# What is bundler package ?
    . bundler packages bundle your app or make a package of you app to production ready 
    . bundler packages are webpack , parcel etc.

# Type of dependancies in package.json
    . Dev dependancies :- Dev dependancies use is develoment face 
    . Normal dependancies :- Normal dependancies use mostaly on production 
    . Transitive dependency:- when one dependency depend on other dependency 
    . We use -D to install dev dependancies exp:- npm install -D parcel

# What is Package.lock.json
    . It keep records of exact veraion of package.
    . package.json keep approximate version of package but package.lock.json keep exact vesrion of package 

# What is node modules
    . Node Module has all the code of packages which we fetch from NPM.
    . It contains all data of packages/dependancies

# NPX (Parcel commands)
    . We use NPX to execute the packages. 
    . NPX parcel index.html
    . NPX parcel build index.htm :- Production build

# Parcel package
    . It's make dev build 
    . It's create local sever 
    . HMR = Hot Module Replacement (AUto refresh browser)
    . It use file watching Algorithem to reflect changes in browser - writen in c++
    . Using caching for faster build
    . Image Optimization
    . Minification files in prodution build
    . Bundling file
    . Compressing file for prodution 
    . Consistent Hashing
    . Code Splitting 
    . Differential Bundling - Give support to older browsers
    . Dignostic 
    . Error Handling
    . HTTS
    . Tree Shaking - Remove unused code
    . Different build for prod and dev

# BrowsweList
    .Browserlist use to make our app Compatible to all the browsers 

# JSX :-
    . JSX is defferent and React is defferent .
    . JSX is syntex to write HTML in react
    . JSX is not a HTM in js. 
    . if we want to give class in JSX :- we use ClassName="xyz" not class like HTML. That's why JSX is not a HTML
    . it's syntax like HTML or XML
    . JSX is not pure or valid javascipt bcz js engine not understand JSX
    . Browser is not understand JSX that is why it's not pure javascipt
    . PARCEL is responsible to transpile the JSX code into browser understan code
    . PARCEL is use BABEL to transpile JSX code.
    . JSX ==> React.CreartElement() ==> React.CreartElement() js object ==> HTMl
    . JSX is not HTML we can't use alot of html attribute in JSX syntax
    . Attribute in JSX use CamalCasing.
    . For multiple like we use () like :-
        (
            <h1>
                hello code.
            </h1>
        ) 
    .JSX is also take care of CROSS attacks 0
    .JSX have only one root parent element.
        exp:-
            (
                <div>
                dfgdfg
                <div> </div>
                
                </div>  
                         --valid(Single root parent element )
            ),
             (
                <div>dfgdfg</div>           ----Invalid(Two root parenr element)
                <div>dfgdfg</div>
            )

# React Fragment
    .Using React fregment we can rape more than one root element in JSX.
          (     <React.Fragment>
                    <div>dfgdfg</div> 
                    <div>dfgdfg</div>
                </React.Fragment>
            ) 
    .This is act as a empty tags 
    .We can use empty tag as well
         (     <>
                    <div>dfgdfg</div> 
                    <div>dfgdfg</div>
                </>
            ) 


# React Components :-
    .Two type of components :-
        Class Based components -- OLD Menthod
        Functional Based Components -- NEW Method
.Functional Component :-
    . Functional Component is simple javascipt function.
    . Functional Compoent name always satrt with capital latter.
.Component Composition:-  is put component inside component



Questions:--
.can we have multiple roots tags
.can we use react fregments inside rect fregments
