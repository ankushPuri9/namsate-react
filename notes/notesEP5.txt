.............Hooks..........

# We have two types of most important Hook
    -useState() - State variable of react
    -useEffect()

. Whenever state variable change react rerander it's components 
. React is good at DOM manipulate

# Reconcilation Algo (React Fiber)
    - Virtual DOM 
        . VD is object representation on actual DOM
        . It is a object of actual DOM
    -Diff Algo
        . Diff Algo find difference between old VD and new VD and then update Actuall DOM
        . It easy to find differeance in object as compare to HTML
        . This process is called React Fiber

# Why react is fast ?
    . React is doing efficiently DOM manipulate
    . React using deff algo to find out the difference bwt old and new VD
    . After that it will only update modified DOM elemets
