# Config driven UI 
# In conponent call looping we should have uniqe key proprty / or In looping we should provide unique id.
    .<Component key={unique.id} data={dataVariable} />
    .We provide keys because rect can easily identified elements in DOM.
    .Unique key help to render only newly added elements in the DOM.
    .Unique key help to optimized the code and make rendering fast and make app faster.
    .If we will not provide any unique key than all the elements are rerendering in DOM and give warning in console. 
    .Using index as a key is not recommended by react
