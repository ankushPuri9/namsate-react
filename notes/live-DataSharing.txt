..............................Data Sharing................

# Props Drilling

    - when we pass pross from parents to multiple child it's called props drilling
        - parent (props)
            child (props)
                child (props)
                    child (props)
                        child (props)
# Lifting the state up......
    - When parent component hold the state and control the child behaver
    - eg:- toggle the child component.but tiggle state variable is manage by parent componnet 

# Rect dev tool in browser :-
    - Componet :- It help to debug componnet state and props 
    -Profiler :- It help to check the rendraing speed on every component 

---------------------------React context to share the data...............

# context:- We use context to share data all across the app.So any componnet get that data
            - It is crearted by the react. 
            - It is like a central space where we can keep the things and any one can access it.
            - We use context to share data in all the components it's different that props and stats
            - States and props are component spacific

# createContext() :- use createContext({initial data}) from react to cretate a context.
# useContext() :- use useContext(contextName)  from react to get a context

# How to use Context in classbase component bcz we don't have hooks in class components
    - Import context eg:- import userContext from "../utils/userContext"
    - use like a component
        <userContext.Consumer>
        { {user} => console.log(user.name)}
        </userContext.Consumer>

# Update Context value :- Use context name and provider to update context value.
    -<ContaxtName.provider value={value}> Component Name<ContaxtName.provider>
    -<ContaxtName.provider value={value}> Component Name(In which we want contaxt auto update)<ContaxtName.provider>
    -    <section className="section">
      <LevelContext.Provider value={level}>
        {children}
      </LevelContext.Provider>
    </section>
